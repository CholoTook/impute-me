Warrior worrier gene notes
rs4680 seems to be one if these - it is already measured in 23andme, though. So not much new is brought in.

Then there's something in the MAOA that could be of interest?
SNPedia mentions this one rs909525. That one is also measured. Oh well.
THere's a good view of the region here:
http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&position=chrX%3A43513464-43515263&hgsid=209581349_vA1SA63yA2FwlvCOuUycyhZ0b5AD
Many papers publish their PCR primers around this one. But it's not in the 1000genomes track so probably not callable. Could perhaps have something to do with this one: chrX:43514418:D - it's a 13 bp deletion exactly in that region. According to PMID 18212819, they find something like 2% of their (violent) subject have the deletion, so it's kinda odd that's it not found in thousand genomes.

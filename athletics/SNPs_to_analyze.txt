rs1815739	11	NA	T	C	C/T	This C variant of this SNP breaks the ACTN3. The T variant have been found to be associated with better sprint performance (PMID 12879365)
rs4646994	17	NA	NA	NA	I/D	ACE - this variant is found in one study to potentially distinguish between capability in power-sports vs endurance-sports (PMID 25943990). However it is also mentioned in several studies of other traits such as hypertension and alzheimers. The evidence behind it's effect remain unclear. Insertations (I) are the ones supposed to be associated with endurance, and deletions (D) with power-sports.
rs699	1	NA	C	T	C/T	AGT - the C allele of this SNP has been found to associate with ability in power-sports (PMID 20029521)
rs1800012	17	NA	NA	NA	G/T	COL1A1 - the T allele was found to be associated with protection against injuries (acute soft tissue ruptures.). PMID 19193665.
rs9939609	16	NA	A	T	A/T	FTO - the A allele for this SNP is associated with obesity. Note that the evidence for this is stronger than remaining findings, and the finding has been replicated many times. The effect size however remains small.
rs7221412	17	NA	G	A	A/G	TRNAS6 - the G allele was found to be associated with later timing in a study of circadian rythm (PMID 23034908)
